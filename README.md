# Facial Expression Recognition with Keras

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras to recognize facial expressions. This project can accurately identify different emotions from images and video streams. The model is then deployed to a web interface using Flask, allowing for real-time facial expression recognition.

## Objectives

- Develop a facial expression recognition model in Keras.
- Build and train a CNN to classify facial expressions.
- Deploy the trained model to a web interface with Flask.
- Apply the model to real-time video streams and image data.

## Project Structure

1. **Introduction and Overview**: Introduction to the project's goals and dataset.
2. **Explore the Dataset**: Visualization and analysis of the Emotion FER dataset.
3. **Generate Training and Validation Batches**: Creation of augmented data batches.
4. **Create a CNN Model**: Designing the neural network architecture.
5. **Train and Evaluate the Model**: Training procedures and performance evaluation.
6. **Save and Serialize Model as JSON String**: Storing the model architecture.
7. **Create a Flask App to Serve Predictions**: Deployment of the model through a Flask application.
8. **Create a Class to Output Model Predictions**: Implementation of a class for loading and predicting with the model.
9. **Design an HTML Template for the Flask App**: Development of a web interface for the application.
10. **Use Model to Recognize Facial Expressions in Videos**: Application of the model to video data.

## Technologies Used

- **Keras** for building and training the CNN model.
- **Flask** for deploying the model to a web interface.
- **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** for data manipulation and visualization.

## Deployment

The trained model is deployed to a Flask web application, enabling users to perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data. The deployment process involves setting up a Flask app to serve model predictions directly to a web interface, allowing for interactive user engagement.
